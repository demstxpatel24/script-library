## Script Library

This repository can serve as a library for scripts for ad-hoc data pulls from REACH and PHOENIX tables

It currently containts the following:

- `validation-reach.sql`: Basic tests to understand the grain of each dataset and how they connect
- `metrics-by-vol.sql`: Query to compute the current state of volunteer-level metrics
- `tag-voted.py`: Sample script for adding tags to voters. This script works but will require links to data to be automated
